In order to access TMMS, a prospective user needs to be invited via email by a Systems Administrator. The email address becomes the unique identifier for this User, however the user is able to modify his profile and create a Username (usually these are shorter and easier to remember). The Username has to be unique amongst all Quickbase Users.

Once the User acknowledges the email invite, he/she is requested to supply their first and last names, to set their password (this must be at least 8 characters and include a number). The user is then asked to choose a question from a selection of standard questions, and provide an answer to be stored on the system. This is used in the event that they forget their password and need to reset it.

Once the user submits this information, another email is sent to the user. On receipt, a link is provided, which takes the user to the login screen to confirm their password.

The user can access the Application Area where they will see a list of the QuickBase applications they have been granted.

In the case of TMMS, they will generally only see two applications:
* The Material Management System, andÂ 
* TMMS - Sandpit - dd-mm-yy.

The first in the list is the live system, and the second in the example above is the Playpen or Sandpit into which they can practice and play around without doing any damage to the live system.

Access to the system is handled entirely by the Quickbase Standard application, and TMMS has no control over this other than by inviting users to access the TMMS application.

Once the user selects an application to use, the user then comes under the control of the access given to them via Roles as described in the next section.
