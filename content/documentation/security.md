TMMS is built on top of the Quickbase platform and uses the features provided by QuickBase to manage security and access to the system.

### Access via Registration
TMMS offers access only to individual registered users who have specified an e-mail address and a password at least 8 characters in length. This is part of the standard application the company subscribes to when signing up for QuickBase

### Permissions that we Control
When we create a database with QuickBase, only the people whom we explicitly invite can actually use it. This means we have complete control over who can view, modify, or add information to our database. In addition, we can limit access to select information within your database through field-level permissions and the use of Roles (more later).

### Security over the Internet
TMMS uses the industry-standard, 128-bit Secure Socket Layers (SSL) protocol to ensure our information is neither intercepted nor corrupted during transmission over the Internet provided by the Quickbase Platform. In addition, QuickBase uses encryption technology to help protect our data when stored on disk.

### What Makes QuickBase Reliable?
QuickBase is not a "dot-com," with a "here today, gone tomorrow" business model. They are a member of the Intuit family of products and services, representing more than $2 billion in annual sales and more than 25 million customers. It's through these resources that they make investments in systems and information reliability.

To assure continued service, data integrity, and customer confidence, they've outfitted their data centre with:

- thoroughly tested intrusion detection software and hardware to stop unauthorized access attempts and other suspicious activity
- the most advanced firewall software available to prevent "spoofing"
- daily back-ups of all information stored with QuickBase to prevent data loss
- 24x7x365 security, including trained personnel, video surveillance, and alarms, to prevent physical breaches
- un-interruptible power supplies (UPS) and multiple back-up generators in case of power outage
- smoke detection and fire suppression systems

In case of natural disaster, they have a second and separate data center that redundantly protects and stores all customer information and assets.

### What Makes QuickBase Confidential?
Over the years, Intuit/Quickbase has adopted strict guidelines and practices so that our private information stays that way. Not even QuickBase personnel are allowed to access the information contained within our databases without our express permission.
